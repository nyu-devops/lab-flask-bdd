This repository is part of lab for the *NYU DevOps* class for Spring 2017, [CSCI-GA.3033-013](http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring17/CSCI-GA.3033-013/) on Behavior Driven Development with Flask and Behave

The sample code is using [Flask microframework](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and is intented to test the Python support on [IBM's Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/) environment which is based on Cloud Foundry. It also uses [Redis](https://redis.io) as a database for storing JSON objects.

## Introduction

One of my favorite quotes is:

_“If it's worth building, it's worth testing.
If it's not worth testing, why are you wasting your time working on it?”_

As Software Engineers we need to have the discipline to ensure that our code works as expected and continues to do so regardless of any changes, refactoring, or the introduction of new functionality.

This lab introduces Test Driven Development using `PyUnit` and `nose`. It also explores the use of using RSpec syntax with Python through the introduction of `noseOfYeti` and `expects` as plug-ins that make test cases more readable.

It also introduces Behavior Driven Development using `Behave` as a way to define Acceptance Tests that customer can understand and developers can execute!

## Setup

For easy setup, you need to have Vagrant and VirtualBox installed. Then all you have to do is clone this repo and invoke vagrant:

    git clone https://github.com/nyu-devops/lab-flask-bdd.git
    cd lab-flask-bdd
    vagrant up && vagrant ssh
    cd /vagrant

You can now run `behave` and `nosetests` to run the BDD and TDD tests respectively.

## Manually running the Tests

Run the tests using `behave`

    $ behave

Run the tests using `nose`

    $ nosetests

Nose is configured to automatically include the flags `--with-spec --spec-color` so that red-green-refactor is meaningful. If you are in a command shell that supports colors, passing tests will be green while failing tests will be red.

## What's featured in the project?

    * ./app/server.py -- the main Service using Python Flask
    * ./tests/test_server.py -- unit test cases for the server
    * ./tests/test_pets.py -- unit test cases for the model
    * ./features/pets.feature -- Behave feature file
    * ./features/steps/steps.py -- Behave step definitions
